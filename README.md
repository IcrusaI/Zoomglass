# Zoomglass
A Fabric mod that quickly puts a spyglass into your hand with a press of a button.  
Immersion of an in-game feature combined with a convenience of a traditional zoom mod!

The default keybind is `c`, and you can find it under the "Invertory" section in keybinding settings.

Requires Fabric API
