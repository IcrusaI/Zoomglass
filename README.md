# Zoomglass
A Fabric mod that quickly puts a spyglass into your hand with a press of a button. 
Made for people who prefer roleplaying aspects of a spyglass but don't want to miss out on convenience!

The default keybind is `c`, and you can find it under the "Inventory" section in keybinding settings.

Requires Fabric API
